🚦 Automatic Railway Crossing System with Arduino & LabVIEW

Description:
This project is an Arduino-based Automatic Railway Crossing System integrated with LabVIEW. The system detects approaching trains using IR sensors 📡 and automatically controls LED signals 💡 and a servo motor barrier 🤖. LabVIEW is used to monitor and control LED intensity 📊, providing a visual interface for the system.

✨ Features:

Automatic train detection & barrier control ⚙️

LED signal indicators for stop/go 💡

Servo motor operated barrier 🤖

LabVIEW interface for monitoring & LED control 📊

Simple and efficient Arduino code 🛠️

🛒 Components Required:

Arduino Uno

IR Sensors (2) 📡

Servo Motor 🤖

LEDs 💡

Resistors & Connecting Wires
